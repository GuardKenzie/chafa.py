Have you ever wanted to display an image your TUI Python application? Well, now you can; with chafa.py!

`Chafa <https://hpjansson.org/chafa/>`_ is a wonderful command-line utility, created by `Hans Petter Jansson`_, for visualizing images in the terminal. In Jansson's own words:
   
   **The future is (still) now!**

   The premier UX of the 21st century just got a little better: With ``chafa``, you can now view very, very reasonable approximations of pictures and animations in the comfort of your favorite terminal emulator. The power of ANSI X3.64 compels you!

chafa.py is a python wrapper for the chafa library so you can use rad graphics in your cool Python applications! The chafa.py library tries to be intuitive and aims to produce very readable code.

Features include
----------------

- Modern and intuitive Python API
- Generate text based approximations of images in (almost) any terminal emulator
- `Sixels <https://www.arewesixelyet.com/>`_, `Kitty <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/>`_ and `ITerm2 <https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html>`_ image protocols support
- Linux, MacOS (x86 and ARM), Windows support


Not convinced? Here's a :download:`picture of a cute snake <usage/snake.jpg>` rendered to text using chafa.py and beamed into your visual cortex through the power of html and css:

chafa.py tries to be very *pythonian* (I think that's a word) in the sense that most getter and setter functions are simply made to be attributes of Python objects.

Here is the program used to output the image you see above::

   from chafa import *
   from chafa.loader import Loader

   # The font ratio of JetBrains Mono (width/height)
   FONT_RATIO = 11/24

   # Create a canvas config
   config = CanvasConfig()

   # Configure the canvas geometry
   config.width  = 40
   config.height = 40

   # Load the snake
   image = Loader("./snake.jpg")

   # Configure the ideal canvas geometry based on our FONT_RATIO
   config.calc_canvas_geometry(
      image.width, 
      image.height, 
      FONT_RATIO
   )

   # Init the canvas
   canvas = Canvas(config)

   # Draw to the canvs
   canvas.draw_all_pixels(
      image.pixel_type,
      image.get_pixels(),
      image.width, image.height,
      image.rowstride
   )

   # Print the output
   output = canvas.print()

   print(output.decode())


That doesn't look that complicated! Take a look at the :ref:`examples` page for more cool examples or the :ref:`tutorial` to learn how chafa.py works. Also, here is a table of contents for these entire docs so you can sort of get a picture of what they cover and where to go:
