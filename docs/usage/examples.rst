Examples
========

On this page you will find a few useful examples (which you can also find in the `GitHub repo`_.) when it comes to using chafa.py. These should cover most of the basics for reading and printing an image and they also include some messing around with :py:class:`chafa.CanvasConfig`.

If you are the sort of person who likes getting their hands dirty right away, take a look at these and read up on the methods and classes used in the api. That should be enough to get you to a pretty good point!

All the examples will be using this image and calling it ``snake.jpg``

.. image:: snake.jpg
    :width: 300
    :align: center

Reading an image
================

Here are several different methods of reading images for using them with chafa.py. They perform similarly so just pick the one you like the most!

.. py:currentmodule:: chafa.loader

Using :py:class:`Loader`
------------------------

The :py:class:`Loader` is a class included with chafa.py which aims making it easy to read and draw images to the :py:class:`chafa.Canvas`, however, it does depend on the `MagickWand`_ C-library.

::

    from chafa import *
    from chafa.loader import Loader

    # Init canvas config
    config = CanvasConfig()

    # Set canvas height and width
    config.height = 30
    config.width  = 30

    # Open image with the loader
    image = Loader("./snake.jpg")

    width      = image.width
    height     = image.height
    rowstride  = image.rowstride

    # Init the canvas
    canvas = Canvas(config)

    # Draw to canvas
    canvas.draw_all_pixels(
        image.pixel_type,
        image.get_pixels(),
        width, 
        height,
        rowstride
    )

    # Write picture
    print(canvas.print().decode())


Using `Pillow`_
---------------

When reading pixel data from an image opened with `Pillow`_, we get a 2D array which needs to be reshaped into a 1D array before passing to chafa. This is still pretty fast since both Pillow and NumPy are well optimized.

::

    from chafa import *
    from PIL import Image
    import numpy as np

    # Init canvas config
    config = CanvasConfig()

    # Set canvas height and width
    config.height = 30
    config.width  = 30

    # Open image with PIL
    image = Image.open("./snake.jpg")

    width  = image.width
    height = image.height
    bands  = len(image.getbands())

    # Put image into correct format
    pixels = np.array(image)
    pixels = np.reshape(pixels, pixels.size)

    # Init the canvas
    canvas = Canvas(config)

    # Draw to canvas
    canvas.draw_all_pixels(
        PixelType.CHAFA_PIXEL_RGB8,
        pixels,
        height,
        width,
        width * bands
    )

    # Write picture
    print(canvas.print().decode())


Using `pyvips`_
---------------

The `pyvips`_ library is another fast image manipulation library which can be used to read images in a pretty straight forward manner.

::

    import pyvips
    from chafa import *

    # Init canvas config
    config = CanvasConfig()

    # Set canvas height and width
    config.height = 30 
    config.width  = 30

    # Open image with vips
    image = pyvips.Image.new_from_file("./snake.jpg")

    width  = image.width
    height = image.height
    bands  = image.bands

    # Init the canvas
    canvas = Canvas(config)

    # Draw to canvas
    canvas.draw_all_pixels(
        PixelType.CHAFA_PIXEL_RGB8,
        image.write_to_memory(),
        width,
        height,
        width * bands
    )

    # Write picture
    print(canvas.print().decode())


.. currentmodule:: chafa

Detecting terminal capabilities
===============================

Here is an example of a program that uses :py:meth:`TermInfo.detect_capabilities()` to figure out what the current terminal is capable of.

::

    from chafa import *
    from chafa.loader import Loader

    # Init canvas config
    config = CanvasConfig()

    # Set canvas height and width
    config.height = 30
    config.width  = 30

    # Init database and get terminal info
    term_db   = TermDb()
    term_info = term_db.detect()

    # Get terminal capabilities
    capabilities = term_info.detect_capabilities()

    # Set config to appropriate modes
    config.canvas_mode = capabilities.canvas_mode
    config.pixel_mode  = capabilities.pixel_mode

    # Open image with the loader
    image = Loader("./snake.jpg")

    width      = image.width
    height     = image.height
    rowstride  = image.rowstride

    # Init the canvas
    canvas = Canvas(config)

    # Draw to canvas
    canvas.draw_all_pixels(
        image.pixel_type,
        image.get_pixels(),
        width, 
        height,
        rowstride
    )

    # Write picture
    print(canvas.print().decode())



Accurate aspect ratio
=====================

Here is an example that outputs the image in the correct aspect ratio.

::

    from chafa import *
    from chafa.loader import Loader

    FONT_WIDTH  = 11
    FONT_HEIGHT = 24

    # Init canvas config
    config = CanvasConfig()

    # Set canvas height, width and cell geometry
    config.height = 30
    config.width  = 30

    # Set the canvas cell geometry
    config.cell_height = FONT_HEIGHT
    config.cell_width  = FONT_WIDTH

    # Open image with the loader
    image = Loader("./snake.jpg")

    width      = image.width
    height     = image.height
    rowstride  = image.rowstride

    # Calculate the appropriate geometry for the canvas
    config.calc_canvas_geometry(width, height, FONT_WIDTH/FONT_HEIGHT)

    # Init the canvas
    canvas = Canvas(config)

    # Draw to canvas
    canvas.draw_all_pixels(
        image.pixel_type,
        image.get_pixels(),
        width, 
        height,
        rowstride
    )

    # Write picture
    print(canvas.print().decode())


Converting image to HTML
========================

This example produces a ``.html`` file version of an image, similar to the one at `index`_. You need to set the display font to some monospace font (e.g. `JetBrains Mono`_) in order for it to work.

:: 

    from chafa import *
    from chafa.loader import Loader

    img_loc     = "snake.jpg"
    output_loc  = "out.html"

    def format_pixel(char, fg, bg):
        # Formats the pixel to html with color applied through style
        style       = f"color: rgb{fg}; background-color: rgb{bg}"
        opening_tag = f"<span class=\"pixel\" style=\"{style}\">"
        closing_tag = f"</span>"

        return f"{opening_tag}{char}{closing_tag}"

    # Font ratio of JetBrains Mono
    FONT_RATIO = 11/24

    # Init config
    config = CanvasConfig()

    config.width  = 40
    config.height = 40

    # Load image
    image = Loader(img_loc)

    # Set up canvas
    config.calc_canvas_geometry(image.width, image.height, FONT_RATIO)

    canvas = Canvas(config)
    canvas.draw_all_pixels(
        image.pixel_type,
        image.get_pixels(),
        image.width, image.height,
        image.rowstride
    )

    # Write the file
    with open(output_loc, "w") as f:
        f.write("<div class=\"chafa-img\">\n")

        # Iterate over pixels in image
        for row in canvas[:]:
            f.write("    <p class=\"row\">\n")
            f.write("        ")
            for pixel in row:
                f.write(
                    format_pixel(
                        pixel.char,
                        pixel.fg_color,
                        pixel.bg_color
                    )
                )

            f.write("\n    </p>\n")

        f.write("</div class=\"chafa-img\">")


Playing around with raw color
=============================

::

    from chafa import *

    # Create config
    config = CanvasConfig()

    config.width = 36
    config.height = (256 - (16+24))  // 36 + 2


    config.canvas_mode = CanvasMode.CHAFA_CANVAS_MODE_INDEXED_256

    # Init an empty canvas
    pixels = [0, 0, 0, 0]

    canvas = Canvas(config)
    canvas.draw_all_pixels(
        PixelType.CHAFA_PIXEL_RGBA8_PREMULTIPLIED,
        pixels,
        1, 1, 3
    )

    # Draw all 256 colors

    # Set the characters to half blocks
    for row in canvas[:]:
        for pix in row:
            pix.char = "â–€"
            pix.remove_foreground()

    
    # Draw the primary 16
    for pix in canvas[0,:16]:
        pix.raw_fg_color = pix.x

    # Draw the rest of the colors
    for row in canvas[1:-1, :]:
        for pix in row:
            pix.raw_fg_color = pix.x + 16 + ((pix.y-1) * 5 * config.width//5)

    # Draw the greyscale gradient
    for pix in canvas[-1, :24]:
        pix.raw_fg_color = 255 - (23 - pix.x)

    print(canvas.print().decode())
