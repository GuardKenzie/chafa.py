Examples
========

On this page you will find a few useful examples (which you can also find in the `GitHub repo`_.) when it comes to using chafa.py. These should cover most of the basics for reading and printing an image and they also include some messing around with :py:class:`chafa.CanvasConfig`.

If you are the sort of person who likes getting their hands dirty right away, take a look at these and read up on the methods and classes used in the api. That should be enough to get you to a pretty good point!

All the examples will be using this image and calling it ``snake.jpg``

Some more examples might be found in the `examples folder <https://github.com/GuardKenzie/chafa.py/tree/main/examples>`_ on GitHub.
