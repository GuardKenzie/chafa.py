These are Python bindings for the amazing terminal image visualiser [Chafa](https://hpjansson.org/chafa/).

## THIS LIBRARY IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT! THERE WILL BE BREAKING CHANGES TO THE API.

- You can take a peek the [TODO](TODO.md) for progress on where the project's at!
- Also, check out the [docs](https://chafapy.mage.black) if you wanna take a look at how the project will look when finished.

Have fun!
